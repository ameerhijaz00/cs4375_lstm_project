### LSTM Temperature Forecasting

## Overview
This project implements a custom LSTM from scratch using NumPy to forecast the next day's temperature based on the Daily Minimum Temperatures dataset.

## Requirements
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to Run
Execute the training script:

python src/train_model.py

## Outputs
The following files will be generated:

- results/plots/training_curve.png
- results/plots/forecast.png
- results/metrics.txt
- logs/experiments_log.txt

## Dataset:
Daily Minimum Temperatures (Melbourne)
